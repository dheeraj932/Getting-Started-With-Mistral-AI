# Getting Started with Mistral AI

## Overview

This repository is a showcase of my successful completion of the "Getting Started with Mistral AI" course. The course provided an in-depth understanding of Mistral AI's models and their applications in various tasks.

## Course Highlights

- **Model Selection**: Learned how to choose the right Mistral model based on task complexity and requirements, including Mixtral 8x7B and Mixtral 8x22B.
  
- **Effective Prompting**: Developed skills in prompting techniques for diverse tasks such as classifications and coding challenges.

- **Function Calling**: Integrated traditional code functionalities with LLM capabilities using Mistral's native function calling.

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Built a basic RAG system incorporating similarity search and embeddings to enhance information retrieval.

- **JSON Mode**: Utilized Mistralâ€™s JSON mode for generating structured responses suitable for software applications.

## Projects

Throughout the course, I completed several hands-on projects, including:

1. **Project 1: Model Selection and Evaluation**
   - Description of the project and key learnings.

2. **Project 2: Advanced Prompting Techniques**
   - Description of the project and key learnings.

3. **Project 3: Function Calling Integration**
   - Description of the project and key learnings.

4. **Project 4: Building a RAG System**
   - Description of the project and key learnings.

5. **Project 5: JSON Mode Application**
   - Description of the project and key learnings.

## Skills Acquired

- Proficiency in selecting and utilizing Mistral AI models.
- Advanced prompting techniques for LLMs.
- Integration of traditional code with LLM functions.
- Development of RAG systems for enhanced data retrieval.
- Application of structured JSON responses in software development.
